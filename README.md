This is an experiment in building a simple platformer using the Go programming language and the Ebiten engine ([ebitenengine.org](ebitengine.org)). It follows the [LOVE Platformer Guide](https://0x72.itch.io/love2d-platformer-guide) by 0x72.

The project features a simple state manager (for switching between pause, play, and dead states), entities that can be interacted with (such as spikes, levers, and floors), and (WIP) enemies. Most of the code is likely wildly inefficient due to this being my first real experiment with Go.

But, it is incredibly fun! I think Go is a simple and elegant language. It is certainly much more constraining than Lua, but I don't yet feel like that's a bad thing. It makes me feel more confident that what I'm building is solid.
