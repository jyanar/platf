# platf

This is an experiment in building a simple platformer using the Go programming language and the Ebiten engine ([ebitengine.org](https://ebitengine.org)). It roughly follows the [LÃ–VE Platformer Guide](https://0x72.itch.io/love2d-platformer-guide) by 0x72.

The project features a simple scene manager, entities that can be interacted with (such as spikes, levers, and floors), different levels, and enemies that move. This is my first project in Go, so things could definitely be improved.

To run the game, clone first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyanar/platf.git
```

Then run:
```go
go run .
```
